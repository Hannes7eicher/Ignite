    It's Friday morning. You wait at the subway station to meet the friend who has your gym card. She's already 10 minutes late so you decide to call her.

    No answer.

    You send her a message and wait for a bit more, but you will need to leave for work soon.

    It's quite crowded today.

    You receive a message from the friend who borrowed your gym card. It says:

    "Hi! Sorry I didn't show up today, forgot to tell you. I put the card in your mailbox yesterday. Hope that works!"

    She could have told you earlier.. Well, at least you'll have it back soon. You put your phone back to your pocket.
