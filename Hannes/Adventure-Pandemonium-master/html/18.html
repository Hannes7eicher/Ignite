            Sophie is working for a start-up that sells intelligent jewelry, that sends calming vibrations when it detects stress. She is very passionate about this job as it is even closely tight to her interests. She is constantly looking for more investors and partnerships and would like to have even more influence on the promoting strategies.

            The CEO told her today that she will get promoted. It is not official yet, but the paperwork should be ready by next Monday. He just couldn't wait to tell her, because he knew how hard she was working towards this the past few years. She was extremely excited and almost didn't dare to believe it. The position is called Director of Media. It will be a big step-up for her. It might require occasional business trips, but Sophie loves to travel, so that's not a problem.
            
            
            Sophie is so excited to tell Alex. Should she call him or wait until she gets home?
