            “Sorry we are late, Sophie did not bring her driving skills with her today..” <br>
            Alex did not even look at Sophie, but she could feel the tension.<br><br>

            “It was not me, a car cut in front of me!” Sophie pointed out.<br><br>
            
            “I’m just kidding, don't be so defensive. God...,” Alex continued. Aaron and Nicky looked a bit confused.<br><br>
            
            “Come on, let’s give you a house tour”, Aaron said and took Alex with him. <br>
            Nicky looked at me “Well, he’s in a mood ha? Is everything alright?”
