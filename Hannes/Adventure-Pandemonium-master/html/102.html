            <i>“Yeah, I am here with Emily. We also wanted to try this place out but we are heading home now. The food was really good” </i>He answered.<br><br>
            
            <i> “Do you want to join, I guess Sophie does not mind. Right Sophie?”</i>. Both Alex and Josef are looking at Sophie.
