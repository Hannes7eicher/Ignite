            The place looks really nice with the interior so when the dessert came, Sophie wanted a photo to post on Instagram. <br><br><br>

            “Can you take a picture of me? I want one with the nice background and the cute dessert in the picture, while I drink my wine” she asked Alex.<br><br>
            
            “Sure,” Alex said.<br><br>
            
            She gave him her phone, with the camera ready.<br><br>
            
            She put her glass of wine close to her lips, pretending to drink.<br><br>
            
            “It looks weird,” Alex said.<br><br>
            
            She changed her position, trying to look more relaxed.<br><br>
            
            “What about now?” Sophie asked.<br><br>
            
            “No, definitely not that angle. Maybe the other side of your face?”  Sophie changed her position. “Okay, this angle isn't that good either”.<br><br>
            
            “Just take the picture anyway?” Sophie suggested.<br><br>
            
            Alex took one carelessly.<br><br>
            
            “Don’t compare yourself to the Instagram “models” that you follow. They are naturally beautiful, so it is easy for them to hit a good angle.” He said as he handed her her phone back. <br><br>
            
            
            
            Sophie noticed Josef is in the restaurant too.
