            Sophie arrives at home <br><br>

            “Are we going to watch a movie?” Sophie continued.<br><br>
            
            
            “No,” said Alex, he sounded cold in his voice. “I’m going to play video games with my friends. But you can do whatever you want,”<br><br>
            
            
            “But I came home for you!”<br><br>
            
            
            “Well if you wanted to be out so badly, you could have just stayed.”
