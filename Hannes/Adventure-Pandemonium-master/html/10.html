            “WATCH OUT” Alex screams. <br><br>

            Sophie pushes down her foot on the break, just in time to avoid an accident. The car just cut in front of her, without blinkers and high speed. Why can’t people drive nowadays???<br><br>
            
            
            
            “Can you PLEASE learn how to drive? You almost killed us both. Next time I am driving.” Alex said, almost spitting out his words.<br><br>
            
            “But it wasn’t me, the car just drove in front of me...”<br><br>
            
            “But if you would have better driving skills you would have reacted better!”
