            "...plus Daniel has only been here for two years.. 
            I have worked so hard for four years to get this promotion.” 
            Sophie continued. She could feel the tears trying to push forward, 
            but wanted to look professional in front of her boss. “Why did you change your mind? 
            What did I do wrong?” <br><br>

            "You haven't done anything wrong, I just believe it will be better like this."<br><br>

            "Why should it be better like this? I don't understand."<br><br>

            "For you, so you don't need to stress so much. It would bring many new responsibilities, 
            the pressure could increase. You know, I was thinking, we can even agree to give you one 
            extra day off per week. You've been working here for a long time. You deserve it! So you 
            will have more time to rest. I really value your work Sophie, don't let this discourage you. 
            I'm sure there will be another time."
