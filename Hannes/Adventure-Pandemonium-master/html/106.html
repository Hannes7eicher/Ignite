            “Yeah?”<br><br>

            “Why are you logged into my Facebook?” <br><br>

            “What do you mean? I am not?” <br><br>

            “Yes you are, come see!” <br><br>



            “Hmm, probably you did it. Maybe you forgot to log out last time.” <br><br>

            “I haven’t used your computer before, especially not for Facebook. And how can I be logged in if I am hacked?? I got thrown out and can’t access it anymore.” <br><br>

            “Well, I didn't even know that I was on your Facebook. Just log out then.”</i><br><br>

            Sophie starts to go through messages to see if she has missed something. And she has. BUT all the messages have been answered by the hacker. 
            In several messages her friends have asked her to hang out, but the hacker has answered that she is going to be with Alex. 
            How does the hacker know that her boyfriend's name is Alex?
