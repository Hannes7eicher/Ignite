        <p>At the IKEA café: <br><br>

            “Hopefully the driver had insurance. I really hope we don’t need to pay for that.” Sophie said.<br><br>
            
            “That we don’t need to pay for that.. Like if you were paying for things..”<br><br>
            
            “Am I not paying for things? Wait, what are you suggesting now?”<br><br>
            
            “I don’t think I need to explain this. Let’s just leave this topic, shall we? And please don’t talk to me in those situations next time, 
            I don’t talk to you when you drive. Actually, in general, you could talk a bit less..” <br><br>
            
            “Wait, I am confused now. We share our finances, I want to be clear on things-” <br><br>
            
            “Sophie, babe. Look at me. I don’t want to argue with you, okay? Love you.” Alex touches Sophie’s hand as he says this.</p>
