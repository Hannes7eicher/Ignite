        <p>Hi Soul 647,</p>

        <p>    you have been selected to substitute Soul 223, who has escaped the body of Sophie Stavoc without permission.<br><br>


            We are working on locating Soul 223 and bringing it back, but in the meantime, we need you to continue in
            Sophie's life as if nothing happened. It is a standard process and it will take several days. To you they
            will probably only seem like minutes, as you will be conscious only during the parts where your input will
            be needed. <br><br>


            Since this will be your first substitution, we will explain everything to you in a moment.</p>
