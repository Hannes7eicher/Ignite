            That night Sophie is lying in her bed and can’t sleep. She thinks about what Josef told her at the café. Is he right? 
            She can’t shake it out of her mind and she is so angry about the hacking. Alex hasn’t confessed that it is him, 
            but she she has this gut feeling that he isn’t telling her the truth anymore. <br><br>

            He is out with his friend right now.
