        The bath was nice but Sophie couldn't enjoy it as her heart was still pounding. <br><br><br>



        An hour later Alex entered the apartment.<br><br>
        
        “Why does it look like you've been crying?” he said.<br><br>
        
        “I did not get the promotion”, Sophie started. Still not sure how to ask him about what her boss told her.<br><br>
        
        “But why are you crying over it? It’s not a life or death situation.”<br><br>
        
        “But I have worked really hard for it. And he gave the promotion to another guy at my job that has only worked there for two years. It is not fair.”<br><br>
        
        “I'm sure he has his reasons. Now you don’t need to spend more time at work and don't have to be so tired all the time when you are home.”
