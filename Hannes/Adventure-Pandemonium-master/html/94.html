            Sophie explained everything to Josef.<br><br><br>



"You know, not to play a psychologist here, but have you heard of emotional abuse?"<br><br>

"I think I heard that term before..." Sophie answered.<br><br>

"It's manipulative behavior, can involve gaslighting, trying to confuse you, make you doubt yourself.. That makes it then easier to control you..."<br><br>

"All relationships have their problems, he can be really romantic too, I don't think it's that..”<br><br>

“I am surprised that he hasn’t banned you from seeing me yet.”<br><br>

“Why would he do that? I think you're exaggerating right now.”<br><br>

“I wish I was, but I don't think so. I read it recently, that about 1 in 3 women in the U.S. are emotionally abused. It's probably the same for Canada. It's not so unlikely that you are one of them.."
