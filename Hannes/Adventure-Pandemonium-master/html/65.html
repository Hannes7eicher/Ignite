            "This is getting very personal, but I know that he is the closest person you have here in Toronto. 
            That you have lived together for a few years. That you are planning to have a registered domestic partnership. 
            He knows you better than anyone else and cares so much about you. <br><br>

            I think in situations like these it is better to accept help. Once again, I am really sorry Sophie and 
            I believe things will turn out great for you, but I need to prepare for another meeting right now."
