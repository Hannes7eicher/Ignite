        <p>Another day at the office... Lunch breaks at the cafeteria are the best parts of the day usually. Not just because of the food, but because you get to hang out with Sophie.
            You always have something to talk about, she is well-read and always surprises you with something you have never heard about. She knows so much about history, the world wars specifically. But also about other cultures and their traditions...
            She inspires you so much!!</p>
