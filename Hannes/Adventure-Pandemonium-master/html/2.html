        <p>To navigate this entire situation, you are given some of our back-up galactic devices.

            It is not known how to operate these exact ones, but there is usually a pattern of having three different aspects.
            
            
            One to select an option,
            
            one to indicate answers that involve a scale or a range of sorts,
            
            one to confirm your choices.
            
            
            You will have to figure it out, but don't lift the middle one! That might cause an alarm to go off.</p>
