            Dear Soul 647, 



            We have located Soul 223, so your services are no longer needed. We thank you very much for taking care of Sophie's life in Soul 223's absence. You have kept her alive and we have registered a great amount of personal development. However, it was not sufficient to make the much-needed life-altering change for Sophie. 
            
            From Soultopilot's analysis we are getting signs of emotional abuse present in her close relationship with Soul 556, known under the name of Alexander Henderson. We will be investigating and analysing this further, as it can mean potential danger for Sophie and Soul 223 might be tempted to escape again. 
            
            Your anger levels were appropriate and led to some necessary confrontations, which helped Sophie uncover parts of what Alexander was doing. In the given situation, however, it could have been better for Sophie to leave.
            
            Anger, when used correctly, is an emotion that can help us stand up for ourselves, or for others. 
            
            We will try to educate Soul 223 to increase its chances of handling this complex situation. 
            
            Your actions were not completely sufficient, but you have started a very important process.
            
            We thank you for taking care of Sophie to the best of your ability. 
            
            
            
            All the best, 
            
            The Soul System
