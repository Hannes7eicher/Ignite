            “He told me that you had talked to him about me not being able to manage my work and private life? Did you say that?” Sophie asked. "I couldn't believe it.."<br><br>
            
            “No, I just wanted to know more about the new position and what it will mean for you, that's all."<br><br>
            
            "But, you told him I have a problem with pills? I don't understand at all."<br><br>
            
            "No, I mean he asked how you're doing, and I just mentioned things as they are.."<br><br>
            
            "So you think I have a problem with pills? But I'm not taking any! What, what is all this?"<br><br>
            
            "What about those small white ones, that you have in the drawer of your night table?"<br><br>
            
            "I haven't taken those for ages. And it was just during that time when I couldn't fall asleep, remember? 
            I don't even have that problem anymore, since I started with meditation." <br><br>
            
            "So what do you want from me now with this talk?"
