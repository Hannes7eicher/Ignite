        <p>She also created this "tradition" with you, when you put a few forks in the bucket for spoons, that people
            take from when picking up a soup in the cafeteria. Sometimes they notice and just exchange it, but you count
            points for everyone who doesn't notice until they put the fork in the soup.
            There are two such pick-up spots, so you divided them and compete against each other.
            One point for you today! It's a guy from the HR department. He even tried to eat his soup with it and all
            the liquid poured through the fork back into the plate. You tell Sophie that there should be an extra point
            for that. You laugh and she says 0.5 point extra is fair.</p>
