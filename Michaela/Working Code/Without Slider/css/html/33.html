            <i>“Hopefully the driver had insurance. I really hope we don’t need to pay for that.”</i> Sophie said.<br><br>
            
            <i> “That we don’t need to pay for that.. Like if you were paying for things..”</i><br><br>
            
            <i>“Am I not paying for things? Wait, what are you suggesting now?”</i><br><br>

            <i> “I don’t think I need to explain this. Let’s just leave this topic, shall we? And please don’t talk to me in those situations next time, 
            I don’t talk to you when you drive. Actually, in general, you could talk a bit less..”</i> <br><br>
            
            <i>“Wait, I am confused now. We share our finances, I want to be clear on things-”</i> <br><br>
            
            <i>“Sophie, babe. Look at me. I don’t want to argue with you, okay? Love you.” </i>Alex said and placed his hand on Sophie's hand.</p>
