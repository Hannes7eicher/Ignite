            During lunchbreak she decided to call Alex because she wanted to go to IKEA.<br><br>


            <i>“Can we go to IKEA? I found a lookalike of the carpet that you liked”</i><br><br>
            
            <i>“Today?”</i><br><br>
            
            <i>“Yes, if you have the time.”</i><br><br>
            
            <i>"Okay, I pick you up at 3"<i><br><br>
            
            
            Sophie took her time coming back to the office from the lunch break today, walking through other hallways than usual. 
            She was peaking into other offices wondering whether she will get a new office too. Just for herself. 
            She liked that idea and continued entertaining it during the afternoon.<br><br>
            
            
            When the clock turned 3, Alex picked her up from work.</p>
