            <i>"Yes, yes, it's fine.. I just didn't want you to join, I was afraid he will get all jealous.."<br><br>

            "Oh, I won't stay, just wanted to check on you. I overheard how he talks to you by the way. With the photo? And some of the things you told me in the past. 
            I just thought I should tell you, please don't get offended or anything..." <br><br>

            "What do you mean? Get offended about what?"<br><br>

            "All this, it can be a part of what's called emotional abuse.."<br><br>

            "Hmm, I'm not sure I know exactly what that refers to, but I don't think I'm "abused".. He's a bit direct, that's all.. I think you're dramatizing this. 
            I've really just had a bad day today.." <br><br>

            "He's coming back. Please just read about it?"<br><br>

            "Okay, maybe? But I think you're being a bit weird.. You should really go now." </i>
