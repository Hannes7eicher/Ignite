            Maybe she can use it to unlock her account! She checks her messages first if the hacker didn’t write to her contacts. <br><br>

            And he did indeed! Oh no. The people are going to think it was her who wrote it, she will have to fix all that.<br><br>
            
            Oh wait, but the things he wrote.. It’s details from her life, that are, well, some of them are..true. It’s almost like the hacker is someone who knows her. Wait...<br><br>
            
            
            
            She scrolls through some messages, there are actually a lot of messages that she has missed BUT been answered by this “hacker”. 
            In several messages her friends have asked her to hang out, but the hacker has answered that she is going to be with Alex. 
            How does the hacker know that her boyfriend's name is Alex?
