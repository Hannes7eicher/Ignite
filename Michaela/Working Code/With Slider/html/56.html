            Sophie decided to take a little break and go for a little walk to the park nearby. <br>
            She needed some fresh air to gather her thoughts and just breathe a little. <br>
            Maybe she was not the perfect candidate for the promotion and have to work even harder in the future. <br><br>
            
            At least she has Alex.
