            “Welcome, follow me to your table.”<br><br>

            When we came to the table there was a bouquet of roses on Sophie's side.<br><br>

            “Is this for me?” Sophie asked and looked at the waiter.<br><br>

            “You have a very lovely boyfriend, you are lucky!” The waiter answered.<br><br>

            <i>“Thank you very much for the help...”</i> he looked at her name tag. <i>"...Zoey"</i> Alex said to the waiter and smiled.
