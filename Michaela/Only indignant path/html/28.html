In the car Sophie couldn’t stop talking about her plans for a redesign of the living room. <br><br>


<i>“..and the carpet could go so great together with the photo frames we have on the wall opposite of the windows. You know which ones? 
The brown-blue ones, with pictures from our vacation in Hawaii. Aand we could also get a new coffee table maybe. 
The one we have is so old and I didn’t manage to make it look nicer when I tried the last time. I think it just needs to be replaced at this point. 
Or maybe I can try to make something out of it, use the wood for a decoration, paint it.. Which colour do you think we should have more of in the room, brown or blue?”</i> <br><br>

Alex doesn’t answer.
