            Sophie explained everything to Josef.<br><br><br>



            <i>"You know, not to play a psychologist here, but have you heard of emotional abuse?"<br><br>

            "I think I heard that term before..."</i> Sophie answered.<br><br>

            <i>"It's manipulative behavior, can involve gaslighting, trying to confuse you, make you doubt yourself.. That makes it then easier to control you..."<br><br>

            "All relationships have their problems.. You know some days I am so convinced that no one would love me as much as he does. 
            You just don't know about all the moments when he makes me feel so special...”<br><br>

            “...I am surprised that he hasn’t banned you from seeing me yet.”<br><br>

            “Why would he do that? I think you're exaggerating right now..”<br><br>

            “I wish I was, but I don't think so. I read it recently, that about 1 in 3 women in the U.S. 
            are emotionally abused. It's probably the same for Canada. It's not so unlikely that you are one of them.."</i>
