            <i>"I had to come and talk to you, I felt really betrayed, you understand."</i><br><br>
                
            <i>"And it's great that you did! I owe you a huge apology. I cannot withdraw Daniel's promotion anymore, but I promise you we will find a solution."</i><br><br>
                
                Sophie just nodded and continued to look at her boss, waiting for more words that she deserved to hear.<br><br>
                
                <i>"I am really sorry Sophie, but we will find a way how to compensate for this. I will work on it, you have my word."</i><br><br>
                
                <i>"Alright,"</i><br><br>
                
                <i>"And when it comes to Alexander, you have my full support. And I will see what I can do regarding the position. Maybe you will be able to hold that presentation tomorrow, at least. I will talk to Daniel, I think he was quite nervous about it anyway.."</i><br><br>
