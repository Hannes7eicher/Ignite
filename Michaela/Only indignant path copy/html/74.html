            She called her mom and as soon she heard her voice her tears started to push forward again. 
            It was a lot of emotions and it was supposed to be a great day today, after all. Not something like this.<br><br>

            <i> "I did not get the promotion mom,"</i> She said. <br><br>
            
            <i>"Oh no, I'm so sorry, I thought it was already decided. Do you know why it got changed?" </i>Her mom said.<br><br>
            
            <i>"Ehm, no, not exactly...". </i>Sophie did not know how to tell her mom that Alex had something to do with it. She could 
            barely believe it herself. <br><br>

            <i>"Maybe you should try to do something about it? I mean I would be angry, it is not fair to make such a promise and then break it."</i><br><br>

            <i>"Yes, maybe it can still be fixed.."</i><br><br>

            <i>"I think so. But this is truly unfair. Don't give up, darling, I believe you will find a solution."

            </i><br><br>
            
            Sophie decided to go home after all.
