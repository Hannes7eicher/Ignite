                <i> "YES, that's what I am suggesting. I don't know, I'm still shocked, but I truly do not have any problems with my mental health. 
                    I am reliable, always on time, always prepared." </i><br><br>
                    <i>"Yes, yes, that's true... You don't need to bring any evaluation from your doctor..."

                    </i><br><br>
                        <i>"I even prepared the presentation for tomorrow already."

                        </i><br><br>
                
                    <i>"Yes, I received it from you, on Saturday evening it was I think? I, uhm, I already forwarded it to Daniel, 
                        since the change came last minute and it would save him some time..."</i><br><br>

                         This was a lot and Sophie realised she is not so much sad as she is actually angry right now. The truth was on her side. 
                         The boss saw that Sophie is really passionate about this and understood that she really might be telling the truth.<br><br>
