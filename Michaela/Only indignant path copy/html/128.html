            Hi Soul 647,<br><br>



your substitution has now come to an end. We have located Soul 223 and accepted its request to retransition.<br>

We thank you very much for this substitution and we will make sure your efforts are rewarded in your future lives.<br><br>



Results:<br><br>

&#x25B6; Enough data was gathered to start a repair process regarding the following attribute: Current life goal [Get a promotion]. <br>
An opportunity will be created to establish justice.<br><br>

&#x25B6; Soul 556, known under the name of Alexander Henderson, has been reported and a further investigation will take place in the following days.<br><br>

&#x25B6; You helped with identifying a new virus, currently under the code <i>Emotional abuse</i>, which seems to be widespread.<br><br>

&#x25B6; Soul 223 no longer perceives anger as a forbidden emotion. It has learned to listen to it and is ready to use it as a tool in the future for 
any of the following: 
<b>[Stand up for itself or others]
     [Be aware of injustice] 
     [Be motivated to create change]</b><br><br>

Thank you again for reporting your emotions genuinely, it has shown to be useful for more than just filling in the database.<br><br>
