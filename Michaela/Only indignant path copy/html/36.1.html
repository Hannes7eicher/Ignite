        <p><i>"Weren't you supposed to be at the buffet yet?"</i> Alex asked.<br><br>

            Sophie has a yearly buffet with her friends which falls on this Saturday. Alex spent the whole morning trying to get Sophie
             to not go because he wanted a movie night. But it is tradition to go once a year, so Sophie really didnâ€™t want to miss it.<br><br>
            
             <i>"Yeah, I just wanted to continue on the presentation you know."</i><br><br>

                    <i>"Yes yes, I probably missed the welcoming toast and some appetizers, but I'm almost finished. This is the front page, look!"</i>
