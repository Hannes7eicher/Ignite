            I have worked so hard for four years to get this promotion.” </i>
            Sophie continued. She could feel the tears trying to push forward, 
            but wanted to look professional in front of her boss. <i>“Why did you change your mind? 
            What did I do wrong?” <br><br>

            "You haven't done anything wrong, I just believe it will be better like this."<br><br>

            "Why should it be better like this? I don't understand."<br><br>

            "For you, so you don't need to stress so much. It would bring many new responsibilities, 
            the pressure could increase. You know, I was thinking, we can even agree to give you one extra day off per week, 
            until you get better. You've been working here for a long time, this is the least I can do for you. 
            So you will have more time to rest. I really value your work Sophie, don't let this discourage you. 
            I'm sure there will be another time. 
            With your situation right now, I think this will be best for everyone.." </i>
