        <p>Sophie decided to give him a few minutes to calm down, and then she can call him again. <br><br>


            *calling Alex*<br>
            
            No answer.<br><br>
            
            
            She decided to text him instead.<br><br>
            
            
                <i>Hey honey, I won’t be out too long. Just one or two drinks and then I come home.</i><br><br>
            
            
            *message sound*<br>
            
            I can pick you up so you don’t have to go home alone. I will be there at 11.<br><br>
            
            
            Sophie looks at the time, it's 9.07, so around 2 hours..<br><br>
