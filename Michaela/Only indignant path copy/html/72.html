            Sophie was a bit distracted while working, but she had this motor inside of her that made her finish 
            all her tasks ahead of time and she was able to get home early.<br><br>
            Alex wasn't home yet and she still had a lot of energy boiling inside of her. 
            It probably came from replaying the conversation with her boss in her head, with the feeling of injustice growing stronger each time she thought about it. 
            Each time, she realised more and more that this cannot be ignored or left unresolved.<br><br>
            She looked for a way to use her energy before talking to Alex about this.
