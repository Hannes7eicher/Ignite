            IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION: <br><br><br>



            You have been selected to substitute Soul 223, who has escaped the body of Sophie Stavoc without permission.<br><br>
            
            
            
            We are working on locating Soul 223 and bringing it back, but in the meantime, we need you to continue in Sophie's life as if nothing happened. <br>
            It is a standard process and it will take several days. To you, they will probably only seem like minutes, as you will be conscious only <br>
            during the parts where your input will be needed.<br><br><br>
            
            
            
            Since this will be your first substitution, we will explain everything to you in a moment.
