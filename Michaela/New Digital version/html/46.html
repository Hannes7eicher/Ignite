                Here<br><br>
            
            
            Some of Sophie’s friends were also leaving so they went outside together. When Sophie opens the car door, Alex said:<br><br>
            
            <i>“You look really dressed down compared to you friends”<br><br>
            
            “I think she looks really nice,” </i>one of Sophie’s friends must have overheard him.<br><br>
            
            <i>“Oh hey Sam,”</i> Alex continued. Sophie thinks that he did know that someone would hear it.<br><br>
            
            <i> “I mean, you have a nice dress and Sophie has jeans on her haha.”<br><br>
            
            “Why does that matter, she looks great. You should be happy to have such a beautiful girlfriend.”</i> She continued, looking annoyed.<br><br>
            
            <i>“Do you need a ride home?”</i> Alex asked, it’s late.<br><br>
            
            <i>“No thanks, I’ll manage.”</i> She said that as she already started to walk.
