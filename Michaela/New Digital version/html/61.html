            <i> "Your time will come!" </i>her boss answered. <br><br>



            Sophie said goodbye to her boss and left his office. 
            She thought maybe her boss is right about this. After all, he was the boss so he might know better!<br><br>



            But either way, she was very excited about this, she worked hard for this, 
            so she is very upset about it.
