            <i>“Sorry we are late, Sophie did not bring her driving skills with her today..”</i> <br>
            Alex did not even look at Sophie, but she could feel the tension.<br><br>

            <i>“It was not me, a car cut in front of me!”</i> Sophie pointed out.<br><br>
            
            <i>“I’m just kidding, don't be so defensive. God...”</i>, Alex continued. Aaron and Nicky looked a bit confused.<br><br>
            
            <i>“Come on, let’s give you a house tour”</i>, Aaron said and took Alex with him. <br>
            Nicky looked at me <i>“Well, he’s in a mood ha? Is everything alright?” </i>
