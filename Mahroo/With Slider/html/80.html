        The run helped Sophie get some of the energy out, but she was still not at peace.<br><br><br>

       
        When she got back, Alex was already home.<br><br>

        <i> “Why does it look like you've been crying?”</i> he said.<br><br>

        <i>“I did not get the promotion,”</i> Sophie started. Still not sure how to ask him about what her boss told her.<br><br>

        <i>“But why are you crying over it? It’s not a life or death situation.”<br><br>

        “But I have worked really hard for it. And he gave the promotion to another guy at my job that has only worked there for two years. It is not fair.”<br><br>

        “I'm sure he has his reasons. Now you don’t need to spend more time at work and don't have to be so tired all the time when you are home.”</i>
