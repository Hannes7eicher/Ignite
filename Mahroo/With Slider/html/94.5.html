            "Dear Soul 647,<br><br>

I hope I don't interrupt, but I have felt that a change is happening in Sophie's life and it attracted me to come back and have a look.

First, I want to apologise for escaping earlier on, but this was my first life and I simply didn't know how to handle it.

It was like I was losing myself, not knowing what I think anymore..<br>

I have been observing you for a while now, I'm sorry. I hope you don't mind. But you are my inspiration, Soul 647. You have already changed a lot, even if you're not aware. I would have never gotten to where you are now. I was wondering why that is and I think I know now.<br><br>



Your anger levels.<br>

They are different from how mine used to be. I was never angry... Or at least so I thought. I think every time I thought I might be feeling anger, Alex made it seem like I'm being wrong, so I just repressed it. Or directed it against me..

So anger is a negative emotion, but it seems like you can use it for something positive? Maybe once you admit it, it becomes a tool for you. Like a hammer, that you can use to destruct or construct.

But yeah, once you admit it.. why is already that so hard sometimes? The very first step: Admitting anger. Why does that feel so forbidden, so wrong... When it's just an emotion, like the other ones. I think that we feel it for a reason. That it tells us something about ourselves, about what is important to us. About what we believe in. That it can help us stand up for ourselves, or for others.<br><br>



I, I think Sophie's life is in better "hands" with you, for a bit longer. I thought I will hide for as long as possible, but you've given me hope.<br><br>



Maybe see you soon.<br>
