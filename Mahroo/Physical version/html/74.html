            She called her mom and as soon she heard her voice she could feel the tears streaming down her face. <br><br>

            <i> "I did not get the promotion mom"</i> she cried. <br><br>
            
            <i>"Oh I'm so sorry darling, I thought it was already decided. Do you know why it got changed?" </i>her mom said.<br><br>
            
            <i>"Ehm, no, not exactly...". </i>Sophie did not know how to tell her mom that Alex had something to do with it. She could 
            barely believe it herself. <br><br>

            <i>"Maybe you should try to do something about it? I mean I would be angry, it is not fair to make such a promise and then break it."</i><br><br>

            <i>"I feel mostly betrayed I think.."</i><br><br>

            <i>"I understand, darling. But this is truly unfair. Don't give up, I believe you will find a solution."</i><br><br>
            
            Sophie decided to go home after all.
