            I wanted to just escape all that, I always felt so guilty when something triggered me. I just didn't allow myself to feel this emotion. It was forbidden. 
            I thought being angry is simply bad and wrong, so when I felt a hint of anger, I tried to avoid it, escape it, hoping it will go away if I don't focus on it. 
            But I think it actually never just goes away on its own.. And so I was escaping it, until I noticed I had escaped my body completely. <br><br>
            
            
            
            Back to you now, they sent me a transcript of your decisions too. I will read it again every time I feel lost. To be inspired by you, 
            to remember that to feel anger is as important as to feel joy. Hope, happiness. That we feel it for a reason. 
            That it tells us something about ourselves, about what is important to us, what is happening around us. 
            About what we believe in. That sometimes action is needed, even when uncomfortable. 
            That it can help us stand up for ourselves, or for others.<br><br>
            
            I was manipulated, but someone like you, who was able to embrace their anger, was able to change things. 
            You didn't hurt anyone with your anger, you used it, instead of supressing it. <br>
            I see now, that admitting one's anger is the first step to being assertive and successfully solving a problem.<br><br>
            
            I think it will help me reconstruct my identity.<br><br>
            
            
            
            I will not let anyone take my anger from me again.<br><br><br>
            
            
            
            Soul 647, thank you.<br><br>
            
            For daring to feel.<br><br>
            
            For saving Sophie."<br><br>
