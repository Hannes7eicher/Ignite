            The bath was nice but Sophie couldn't enjoy it as her heart was still pounding. <br><br>

            An hour later Alex entered the apartment.<br><br>

            <i> “Why does it look like you've been crying?”<i> he said.<br><br>

            <i>“I did not get the promotion,”</i> Sophie started. Still not sure how to ask him about what her boss told her.<br><br>

            <i>“But why are you crying over it? It’s not a life or death situation.”<br><br>

            “But I have worked really hard for it. And he gave the promotion to another guy at my job that has only worked there for two years. It is not fair.”<br><br>

            “I'm sure he has his reasons. Now you don’t need to spend more time at work and don't have to be so tired all the time when you are home.”</i>
