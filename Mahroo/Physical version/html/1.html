            There has been a change in controlling the environment, while you were gone, busy living on Earth.<br>
            
            You need to know about it to navigate situations during your in-between lives phase.<br><br><br>
            
            
            
            To navigate this entire situation, you will be using:<br><br><br>
            
            Tap the device to your left, to go through different alternatives.<br><br>
            
            Use your power to press down the knob in the middle to indicate your emotions when asked for it. How hard you press matters.<br><br>
            
            Press the object to the right to confirm your choice.<br><br>
