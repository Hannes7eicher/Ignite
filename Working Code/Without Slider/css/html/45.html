        <p>Sophie decided to give him a few minutes to calm down, and then she can call him again.


            *calling Alex*
            
            No answer.
            
            
            She decided to text him instead.
            
            
                Hey honey, I won’t be out too long. Just one or two drinks and then I come home.
            
            
            *message sound*
            
            I can pick you up so you don’t have to go home alone. I will be there at 11.
            
            
            Sophie looks at the time, it's 9.07, so around 2 hours..
