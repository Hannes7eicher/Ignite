            The place looks really nice with the interior so when the dessert came, Sophie wanted a photo to post on Instagram.

            “Can you take a picture of me? I want one with the nice background and the cute dessert in the picture, while I drink my wine” she asked Alex.
            
            “Sure,” Alex said.
            
            She gave him her phone, with the camera ready.
            
            She put her glass of wine close to her lips, pretending to drink.
            
            “It looks weird,” Alex said.
            
            She changed her position, trying to look more relaxed.
            
            “What about now?” Sophie asked.
            
            “No, definitely not that angle. Maybe the other side of your face?”  Sophie changed her position. “Okay, this angle isn't that good either”.
            
            “Just take the picture anyway?” Sophie suggested.
            
            Alex took one carelessly.
            
            “Don’t compare yourself to the Instagram “models” that you follow. They are naturally beautiful, so it is easy for them to hit a good angle.” He said as he handed her her phone back.
            
            
            
            Sophie noticed Josef is in the restaurant too.
