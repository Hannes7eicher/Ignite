            Josef is already waiting in the caf√©, she is a little late. He waved at her when she entered the door and pointed to a cup of coffee already waiting for her.



"Hi, did anything happen?" Josef saw immediately that something is not alright.

"Yeah, a lot happened."

"I thought it was serious since you called me on my number. You usually text me on Messenger."

"It is serious, I think, but I called you because my Facebook account got hacked a few days ago, that's another story.."

"Oh, so what's the deal?"
