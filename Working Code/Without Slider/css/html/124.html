            Dear Soul 647, 



We have located Soul 223, so your services are no longer needed. We thank you very much for taking care of Sophie's life in Soul 223's absence. You have kept her alive and we have registered a beginning of a change. 

As you started to suspect, Soultopilot's analysis is giving signs of emotional abuse present in her close relationship with Soul 556, known under the name of Alexander Henderson. We will be investigating and analyzing this further, as it can mean potential danger for Sophie and Soul 223 might be tempted to escape again.

It is probable that your anger levels were not sufficient to recalibrate Soultopilot into giving you more assertive choices. At least you started to gather some knowledge. 

Anger, when used correctly, is an emotion that can help us stand up for ourselves, or for others. More confrontation was needed to make a change for Sophie. It is not a shame to feel negative emotions. We can use them as tools. 

However, we thank you for taking care of Sophie to the best of your ability. Perhaps your next substitution will be more life-altering.  



All the best, 

The Soul System
