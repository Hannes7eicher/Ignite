        <p>Sophie got into the car.

            “She wasn’t very nice. Sometimes I don’t get how you can be friends. You should maybe look for other friends.” Alex started.
            
            “What do you mean, I love Sam. You always have some kind of problem with my friends...”
            
            “Well, you always choose the weirdest friends.. What do you even have in common anyway? Is she interested in your little crafts you do at home? Haha.”
            
            “I don’t know, there’s always something to talk about, she’s nice to me...”
            
            “You didn’t seem to have had so much fun though. What did you do the whole time, just talked sitting in a bar?”
            
            “Yeah well and before there was the buffet..”
            
            “So you were eating? And then talking? Wow, so exciting haha. Sometimes I think that your idea of fun is kind of sad to be honest.. But it's not like you're this social person who is always fun to be around, so I guess it makes sense. ”</p>
