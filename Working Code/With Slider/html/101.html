            The place looks really nice with the interior so when the dessert came in Sophie wanted a photo that she could post on Instagram. <br><br><br>

            <i>“Can you take a picture of me? I want one with the nice background and the cute dessert in the picture while I drink my wine”</i> she asked Alex.<br><br>

            <i>“Sure,”</i> Alex said.<br><br>

            She gave him her phone, with the camera ready.<br><br>

            She put her glass of wine close to her lips, pretending to drink.<br><br>

            <i>“It looks weird,”</i> Alex said.<br><br>

            She changed her position, trying to look more relaxed.<br><br>

            <i>“Like this then?”</i> Sophie asked.<br><br>

            <i>“No, definitely not that angle. Maybe the other side of your face?”</i>  Sophie changed her position. <i>“Okay, this angle isn't that good either”.<br><br>

            “Just take the picture anyway?” </i>Sophie suggested.<br><br>

            Alex took one carelessly.<br><br>

            <i>“Don’t compare yourself to the Instagram “models” that you follow. They are naturally beautiful, so it is easy for them to hit a good angle.” </i>
            He said as he handed her her phone back.<br><br>



            Sophie noticed Josef is in the restaurant too.
