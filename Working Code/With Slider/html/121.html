"I'm glad I found you here, couldn't reach you on Messenger. Are you alright? I heard about the promotion thing from Sam.." Josef said, worried about Sophie.

"Yes, yes, it's fine.. I just didn't want you to join, I was afraid he will get all jealous.."

"Oh, I won't stay, just wanted to check on you. I overheard how he talks to you by the way. With the photo? And some of the things you told me in the past. I just thought I should tell you, please don't get offended or anything..."

"What do you mean? Get offended about what?"

"All this, it can be a part of what's called emotional abuse.."

"Hmm, I'm not sure I know exactly what that refers to, but I don't think I'm "abused".. He's a bit direct, that's all.. I think you're dramatizing this. I've really just had a bad day today.."

"He's coming back. Please just read about it?"

"Okay, maybe? But I think you're being a bit weird.. You should really go now."
