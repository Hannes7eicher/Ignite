            Now let’s hit the road. The drive will take 26 minutes. The friends are also a couple, in their age, but they moved away from the city and they have not been hanging out together as much anymore after that.
            
            They got a bit stuck in the traffic on the way there. <br><br>
            
            <i>“We have to skip the walk now, I was really looking forward to it,”</i> Sophie said. <br><br>
            
            <i>“Shall we tell them that we will be a bit late and go there anyway?"</i>
