            Sophie puts the phone against her ear again.
            
            “They just asked me if I wanted to come with them to the bar, so I will come home later”
            
            “Do you really need to go out tonight? You have already been away for 2 hours, I am waiting for you here at home.”
            
            “Yeah, I really want to go. You were out with your friends yesterday, and today it is my turn.”
            
            Alex hangs up the phone.
            
            
            
            Sophie decides to give him a few minutes to calm down, and then she can call him again.
