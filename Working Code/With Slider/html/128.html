            "Dear Soul 647,

            <br><br><br>

            I don't know where to begin. I want to apologise for escaping earlier on, but this was my first life and I simply didn't know how to handle it.<br><br>
            
            It was like I was losing myself, not knowing what I think anymore. Now I know it was because of the emotional abuse. I didn't know that was "a thing"...<br><br>
            
            
            
            I don't know what I would have done without you. I can't imagine coming back to this life how it was before. Now I can finally enjoy being Sophie again. 
            I almost forgot about all the plans I had for her. I can see clearly again, and that's all thanks to you and your actions. 
            Your resilience, the fact that you kept your own thinking and your own opinions. That you weren't hiding your pain, that you dared to speak up for yourself. 
            Or I mean, for Sophie. You made life-changing decisions for Sophie by being assertive and you prepared a ground for me, where I can now take over again.<br><br>
            
            
            
            I was allowed to look at your reports and I'm thinking, maybe it was the anger that fueled you the most throughout this journey. I was truly manipulated by Alex before. 
            Admitting anger was quite impossible for me, I had a distorted perception of things.. I was very confused. 
            He made me doubt myself to such extremes that I really didn't even know who I was at the time. 
            I didn't realize that I had the right to be angry about the way he was treating me.. Sometimes I tried, but he made it feel so wrong. 
            I felt like I wasn't allowed to be angry. Like I was just supposed to give in, be nice to everyone. Not to create problems by disagreeing, expressing myself.<br><br>
