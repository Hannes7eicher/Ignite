            "Dear Soul 647,

            <br><br><br>

            I don't know where to begin. I want to apologise for escaping earlier on, but this was my first life and I simply didn't know how to handle it.<br><br>
            
            It was like I was losing myself, not knowing what I think anymore. Now I know it was because of the emotional abuse. I didn't know that was "a thing"...<br><br>
            
            
            
            I don't know what I would have done without you. I can't imagine coming back to this life how it was before. Now I can finally enjoy being Sophie again. 
            I almost forgot about all the plans I had for her. I can see clearly again, and that's all thanks to you and your actions. 
            Your resilience, the fact that you kept your own thinking and your own opinions. That you weren't hiding your pain, that you dared to speak up for yourself. 
            Or I mean, for Sophie. You made life-changing decisions for Sophie by being assertive and you prepared a ground for me, where I can now take over again.<br><br>
            
            
            
            I was allowed to look at your reports and I'm thinking, maybe it was the anger that fueled you the most throughout this journey. I was truly manipulated by Alex before. 
            Admitting anger was quite impossible for me, I had a distorted perception of things.. I was very confused. 
            He made me doubt myself to such extremes that I really didn't even know who I was at the time. 
            I didn't realize that I had the right to be angry about the way he was treating me.. Sometimes I tried, but he made it feel so wrong. 
            I felt like I wasn't allowed to be angry. Like I was just supposed to give in, be nice to everyone. Not to create problems by disagreeing, expressing myself.<br><br>
            
            I wanted to just escape all that, I always felt so guilty when something triggered me. I just didn't allow myself to feel this emotion. It was forbidden. 
            I thought being angry is simply bad and wrong, so when I felt a hint of anger, I tried to avoid it, escape it, hoping it will go away if I don't focus on it. 
            But I think it actually never just goes away on its own.. And so I was escaping it, until I noticed I had escaped my body completely. <br><br>
            
            
            
            Back to you now, they sent me a transcript of your decisions too. I will read it again every time I feel lost. To be inspired by you, 
            to remember that to feel anger is as important as to feel joy. Hope, happiness. That we feel it for a reason. 
            That it tells us something about ourselves, about what is important to us, what is happening around us. 
            About what we believe in. That sometimes action is needed, even when uncomfortable. 
            That it can help us stand up for ourselves, or for others.<br><br>
            
            I was manipulated, but someone like you, who embraced their anger, was able to change things. 
            You didn't hurt anyone with your anger, you just used it to be assertive, instead of repressing it. <br><br>
            
            I think it will help me reconstruct my identity again.<br><br>
            
            
            
            I will not let anyone take my anger from me again.<br><br><br>
            
            
            
            Soul 647, thank you.<br><br>
            
            For daring to feel.<br><br>
            
            For saving Sophie."<br><br>
