        <p>“What time are we leaving? ” Alex asked.

            “Hmm, we can leave around 5:30, I think it takes around 30 minutes to get there,” Sophie answered.
            
            
            It is Sunday morning and Sophie and Alex are having scones. They have it as a little tradition to always makes scones on Sundays to enjoy the morning together. Tonight they are going to their friends that live out of town.
