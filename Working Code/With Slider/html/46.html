                Here
            
            
            Some of Sophie’s friends were also leaving so they went outside together. When Sophie opens the car door, Alex said:
            
            “You look really dressed down compared to you friends”
            
            “I think she looks really nice,” one of Sophie’s friends must have overheard him.
            
            “Oh hey Sam,” Alex continued. Sophie thinks that he did know that someone would hear it.
            
            “I mean, you have a nice dress and Sophie has jeans on her haha.”
            
            “Why does that matter, she looks great. You should be happy to have such a beautiful girlfriend.” She continued, looking annoyed.
            
            “Do you need a ride home?” Alex asked, it’s late.
            
            “No thanks, I’ll manage.” She said that as she already started to walk.
