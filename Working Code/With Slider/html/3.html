            Regarding Sophie's life, we will introduce you to her current life situation and our Soultopilot will help you by making some of the decisions for you. 
            It will do so based on Sophie's previous behavior and the data we have from Soul 223. <br> <br>

            To avoid chaos, this whole process will be presented to you like a story, always informing you about the date and time, as during some parts you will not be conscious. <br> <br>
            
            This way the process is made easier for every"body", and you will be asked to make a decision when Soultopilot's intelligence does not suffice.
            
            
            
            Your role in this is crucial.
