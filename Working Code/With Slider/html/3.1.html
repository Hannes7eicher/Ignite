            The device in the middle is only used in certain scenarios. <br>
            To use it the top part must be pressed into the base. You might want to be standing up when using it and
            don't be afraid of using your bodyweight for interacting with it.<br>
            Try it to see what happens.
=======
            IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION: <br> <br>



            You have been selected to substitute Soul 223, who has escaped the body of Sophie Stavoc without permission. The soulmates will need to wait. <br> <br>
            
            
            
            We are working on locating Soul 223 and bringing it back, but in the meantime, we need you to continue in Sophie's life as if nothing happened. 
            It is a standard process and it will take several days. To you, they will probably only seem like minutes, as you will be conscious only 
            during the parts where your input will be needed. <br> <br>
            
            
            
            Since this will be your first substitution, we will explain everything to you in a moment.
