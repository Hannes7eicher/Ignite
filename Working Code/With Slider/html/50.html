        <p>Sophie walked into the room to see everyone celebrating around Daniel. She wondered what it was about and was starting to 
            sense that something was not the way she would want it to be.<br><br>

            <i> "What are you guys celebrating?"</i> Sophie asked.<br><br>
            
            <i>"You haven't heard?! Here we present you Daniel, the Director of Media! The title of the position even goes well with his name, this must have been fate."<br><br>
            
            "Oh, Daniel got promoted you mean? For the..em.. Director of Media position?"<br><br>
            
            "Yes! That's what I'm telling you! After just two years working here, he must be doing his job real good."<br><br>
            
            "Ehm, yeah, I suppose."<br><br>
            
            "What, don't you think Daniel is great? Hmm, how long is it that you've been working here, four years? You must be able to tell a talented guy apart at this point!"</i>
