            “Okay,” she could hear Alex answer.
            
            “Are we going to watch a movie?” Sophie continued.
            
            
            “No,” said Alex, he sounded cold in his voice. “I’m going to play video games with my friends. But you can do whatever you want,”
            
            
            “But I came home for you!”
