            <i>"Oh no, what's wrong with my computer now.."</i> Sophie sighs and thinks to herself. It’s frozen. She tries to restart it but it isn't responding. 
            She needs to fix some documents for work tomorrow. She could use Alex's computer. He is in the shower and she needs it just for 10 minutes. <br><br>



            When opening the browser she directly enters Facebook. At the same time that she is going to type in another address, she notices that it is her profile picture on there. 
        <i>Wait what is this?</i> Sophie thinks for herself. She is already logged into her Facebook account on Alex’s computer.
             She doesn't remember logging in there before.
